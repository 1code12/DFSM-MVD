# Dynamic Fusion of Shared and Modality-Specific Features for Multi-Modal Vulnerability Detection
## Code repository for the study
In this study, we empirically study different existing Deep Learning Based Vulnerability Detection techniques for real world vulnerabilities. We test the feasibility of existing techniques in three different datasets.

## Requirement
Our code is based on Python3 (>= 3.7). There are a few dependencies to run the code. The major libraries are listed as follows:
- torch (==1.9.0)
- dgl (==0.7.2)
- numpy (==1.22.3)
- sklearn (==0.0)
- pandas (==1.4.1)
- tqdm
- transformers
## Preprocessing
To generate the AST sequence, please run [ast_sequence.py](https://github.com/1code12/DFSM-MVD/blob/main/Data_process/ast_sequence.py).
For processing code and generating the Code Property Graph (CPG), please refer to the [AMPLE](https://github.com/AMPLE001/AMPLE) or [Reveal](https://github.com/VulDetProject/ReVeal).
